    "In the case of a), randomizing the array allows us to avoid the worst case O(n^2) of deterministic quicksort when all elements are to one side of the pivot, and the recursion tree height would be O(n), leading to the overall complexity of O(n^2). If we do a), the expected runtime would be O(nlogn) + O(n) = O(nlogn). Doing b) is pointless in regards to a) because we have the same chance to set a particular element as a pivot, with or without median of 3."

Doing such a comparison provided an insight why randomized quicksort would yield a better practical result, even though it takes additional O(n) to randomize the input. This is because in randomized quicksort, even if the input was intentionally put as a sorted array (for deterministic quicksort, this would be O(n^2)), we would still have the expected running time O(nlogn) when we do the probabilistic analysis. Instead of randomizing, we could also use the median-of-3 approach to deal with the sorted array case, in which we would more likely select a pivot that will provide a more even split."
